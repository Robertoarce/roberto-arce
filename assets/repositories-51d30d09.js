By using Jinja templating within DBT, the script handles variability in      data availability across different Datasets, ensuring that the final      dataset is as complete and error-free as possible.  This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where data      schema may vary significantly across different entities within the same data warehouse environment.",technologies:["googlecloud","dbt","jinja"],images:["shopify.jpg"],git_link:"https://github.com/Robertoarce/dbt-dynamic-sourcing/",ongoing:!1,in_startpage:!0,notebook_url:""}];function a(){return new Promise(e=>{setTimeout(()=>{e(i)},1e3)})}export{a as f};
